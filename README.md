# Arduino BGA Rework Station Controller
Code for Arduino based BGA Rework Station controller using a solid state relay and a k-type thermocouple.

The code is based on the work by Norcal Reballer from the http://bgamods.com forum and his code helped me a lot to understand how PID controllers should work.

This is not a finished product. This software is a part of a bigger plan for building a BGA rework station, consisting of the station itself, controlled by an Arduino running this software and a Java desktop application for command and control. There is still work to be done, but maybe someone will find use for it.
